        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        Re-Resolver is a preservation attempt to revive Resolver - a once highly-rated decision making app created in Iceland - from oblivion by system updates. The code is open source and <a href="https://github.com/keithgee/Re-Resolver">available at GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        
        <p>
        Re-Resolver does not contain any decision-making intelligence; it relies on a process that is statistically similar to randomness. Do not use Re-Resolver for important decisions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As with nearly all software, Re-Resolver contains bugs. Do not ever rely on technology for anything critical.
