# ReResolver Privacy Policy

## Scope

This privacy policy applies to the version of the [ReResolver App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reresolver/id1137642671?mt=8) currently available in the App Store, as linked here. The policy does not apply to clone versions of ReResolver that have been customized by other developers. If you have any concerns, please be sure that you are using the official version of the app from the app store as linked here.

## Data collection

The developers of the ReResolver app do not collect any data from users. The following data is stored locally on your device:

- Color scheme preference
- "Previous Choices", items that you have entered into the Choose screen but not yet deleted from the Previous Choices list

The data is encrypted according to the default behavior of your iOS device.

If you perform a backup of your device, to local storage or via the cloud, this data may be retained in your backup. The developers of ReResolver do not have access to data stored within your backups.

## Data sharing

This app does not share any user data with third parties, and the developers do not have access to any data.

## Data retention

No data is retained through the use of this app.

All data and user preferences that are stored locally on your device are deleted when the app is deleted from your device. The data may still exist in any old copies of your personal device backups, which you may also delete as required.

In order to delete a specific "Previous Choice" from your device, navigate to the "Previous Choices" list (Choose->+->Recent), and then swipe from right to left on the table row that contains the choice which you wish to delete.

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests about your data, you may open an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker for this project](https://github.com/keithgee/Re-Resolver/issues).


## Updates to this Privacy Policy

On occasion, additional functionality may be added to the app that will require updates to the Privacy Policy. One (hypothetical and currently unplanned) example of such an update might be synchronization of your "Previous Choices" list across devices. A possible implementation of this feature would require sending your "Previous Choices" data across a network to a central location, where it would be downloaded by each of your devices.

Should the Privacy Policy change substantially due to requirements of new features, the maintainers of the ReResolver app will time the updates to the Privacy Policy with the release of the new version in the App Store, and publish mention of the changes in the release notes for the new version of the app.
