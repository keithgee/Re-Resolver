# Re-Resolver

Re-Resolver is a preservation attempt to revive Resolver - a once highly-rated decision
making app created in Iceland - from oblivion by system updates. The code is open source.

## Requirements

### Build Requirements
- Xcode 10.2
- Swift 5.0 (included with Xcode 10.2)

This app may also build with Swift 4.2, but this configuration will not be maintained.

You may also obtain a recent version of the app 
[from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reresolver/id1137642671?mt=8).

#### Build Status
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/keithgee/Re-Resolver.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/keithgee/Re-Resolver)

Continuous integration testing infrastructure and tools have been generously provided by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

### Hardware requirements

- iPhone 5 or newer with any version of iOS 10 through iOS 12 (iOS 9 is no longer supported)

The app will also run on iPads with the required operating system via the built-in iPhone
simulator, though the experience is not optimal.

## Disclaimer

Re-Resolver does not contain any decision-making intelligence; it relies on a process that
 is statistically similar to randomness. Do not use Re-Resolver for important decisions.

As with nearly all software, Re-Resolver contains bugs. Do not ever rely on technology 
for anything critical.
